     No pilgrim has ever seen a god.
     I'm struggling in my way just like everyone. Sadness, happiness, passion, depression are all the same in my tragic life. 
     For me, every paths we has chosen lead to death, in the view of universe, everything is meaningless. 
     However, machine won't feel meaningless, so as monsters. We are trying to deny our exsistence, so we feel meaningless.
     I have many things to do, is neither a job at the mercy of others, nor a salary that everyone admires.
     I want to live as myself, just like this.
     I will walk in my life way til death, like every pilgrim does.
     May world cruel, I'm just dust and ash, so as I pray.
