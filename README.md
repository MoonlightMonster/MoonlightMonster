     没有朝圣者见过神明。
     我只是奔疲于世的芸芸众生之一。
     但我不想生活磨却我的生命。
     纵使事无结局，吾亦往之，毋问价值，毋问代价。
     就像我的生命，枯竭在追寻自我意志的朝圣之路上。
     愿尘土归终。
     
     No pilgrim has ever seen a god.
     I am an ordinary person struggling to make a living as everyone. 
     But I don't want to live up to my wishes, my ideas, my love for art. 
     So some things will not work out in the end, but I will keep doing it. 
     Like my life, exhausted on a pilgrimage in pursuit of my own will.
     Dust to dust, and ash to ash. So as I pray.
